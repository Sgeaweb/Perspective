# Perspective

A quick and small project created based on an idea I thought was original until I had seen someone else had talked about it. Putting life into perspective by counting the days/months/hours/minutes/second/etc and representing each one with boxes.

This is based on days and is calculated using the average of US life expectancy [77 according to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy) and assumes you'll live to that age and die on your birthday (what a thrilling birthday that must be)
